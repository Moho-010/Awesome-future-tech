      The energy available due to the difference in the temperature of water at
      the surface of the ocean and at deeper levels is called ocean thermal
      energy (OTE). The devices used to harness ocean thermal energy are called
      Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion power plants (or OTEC power plants). The
      OTEC concept was first proposed in the early 1880s by the French engineer
      Jacques-Arsène d'Arsonval. His idea called for a closed-cycle system, a
      design that has been adapted for most present-day OTEC pilot plants. Such
      a system employs a secondary working fluid (a refrigerant) such as
      ammonia. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) is a renewable energy
      technology which generates electricity using sea water. 71% of the world's
      surface is covered by ocean. This means that a large amount of solar
      energy is constantly warming the upper layers of the oceans. <br />
      <span class="cls">Working principle : </span>OTEC uses the ocean's warm
      surface water with a temperature of around 25°C (77°F) to vaporize a
      working fluid, which has a low-boiling point, such as ammonia. The vapor
      expands and spins a turbine coupled to a generator to produce electricity.

      OTEC technology generates electricity from turbines turned by steam
      produced from heating the warmer surface waters of the sea into steam. The
      steam is then condensed by the deeper colder waters which are pumped up
      from depths of around 1000 metres. Lockheed Martin has been investigating
      the possibility of harnessing the differences in temperature in ocean
      waters for the production of electricity, and for the past few years have
      been putting the technology through its paces in Hawaii. However, the
      tests, supported by the Energy Department, the US Navy and Makai Ocean
      Engineering, were largely unsuccessful as a fully functional plant could
      not materialise from their efforts. That failure has however not deterred
      the Pentagon, as it has stuck to its aim of putting up an OTEC plant of 5
      to 10 MW capacity, expandable to a commercial capacity of 100 MW. This
      will be borne out of the continued partnership between Makai Ocean
      Engineering and the US Navy, since Lockheed Martin has now established a
      partnership with Reignwood Group.
